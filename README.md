Trinkerr Live Interview for React Problem Statement You need to create the search functionality, where the user can search a desired stock from the list of stocks. You will require API 1 and 2 from the Documentation. You need to make the API fetching as efficient as possible. You need to create a simple form, where the user can send a POST request to API number 3 and add the relevant data, and make sure you handle the necessary errors which is thrown. Note You need to implement the problem statement in order. Only if you are done with problem statement 1, you need to move the next one. All the very best.

API Documentation BASE_URL: http://3.108.225.220:5000

GET /api/user-access-token This API will fetch the user-access-token, which will be required in the headers of the other private API Requests GET /api/data?search_string= This API will require the user-access-token as one of the header parameters, otherwise it will throw an unAuthorized Error. It takes search_string as one of the query parameters and returns the data which matches the string. POST /api/data This API will also require the user-access-token as one of the header parameters. The data should be in the format as fetched from the GET API call. Example { "name": "....", "ltp": 20, "lcp": 30 } Note You need to deploy your code to any of your preferred choice like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku etc.
